# Coursera_Capstone

This repository contains jupyter notebook file and report. This project is part of coursera [course](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science).

## Overview :
Data science is one of the hottest professions of the decade, and the demand for data scientists who can analyze data and communicate results to inform data driven decisions has never been greater. This Professional Certificate from IBM will help anyone interested in pursuing a career in data science or machine learning develop career-relevant skills and experience. 

It’s a myth that to become a data scientist you need a Ph.D. Anyone with a passion for learning can take this Professional Certificate – no prior knowledge of computer science or programming languages required – and develop the skills, tools, and portfolio to have a competitive edge in the job market as an entry level data scientist.

The program consists of 9 online courses that will provide you with the latest job-ready tools and skills, including open source tools and libraries, Python, databases, SQL, data visualization, data analysis, statistical analysis, predictive modeling, and machine learning algorithms. You’ll learn data science through hands-on practice in the IBM Cloud using real data science tools and real-world data sets.

Upon successfully completing these courses, you will have built a portfolio of data science projects to provide you with the confidence to plunge into an exciting profession in data science.

In addition to earning a Professional Certificate from Coursera, you'll also receive a digital badge from IBM recognizing your proficiency in data science. (TAKEN FROM : [COURSERA](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science)).

## Why this Course?
I am very curious about how data works. In such a new field, finding consensus around one single definition is hard. But in my opinion, data science is the process of creating (business) value from data. Data is new oil of present day.  I am particularly curious about say how company decides Discount/Offers, how company or any organization knows what to select, which parameters are more important, when should these offers be rolled out, for how many days offer should be there. This is one of the example which might require critical data analysis.
